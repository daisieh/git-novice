<p>We've all been in this situation before: it seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, like Microsoft Word (&quot;Track Changes&quot;) or Google Docs version history.</p>
<p>Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then save just the changes you made at each step on the way. You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/play-changes.svg" alt="Changes are saved sequentially" /><p class="caption">Changes are saved sequentially</p>
</div>
<p>Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then think about &quot;playing back&quot; different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document. For example, two users can make independent sets of changes based on the same document.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/versions.svg" alt="Different versions can be saved" /><p class="caption">Different versions can be saved</p>
</div>
<p>If there aren't conflicts, you can even try to play two sets of changes onto the same base document.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/merge.svg" alt="Multiple versions can be merged" /><p class="caption">Multiple versions can be merged</p>
</div>
<h2 id="how-git-works">How Git works</h2>
<p>A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us and helps us version and merge our files. A system like Git is designed to keep multiple sets of versions and changes in sync across different computers or servers. This is called a <em>distributed</em> system.</p>
<p>A <a href="reference.html#repository">repository</a> is the set of files that we want to keep under version control.</p>
<p>With Git, every user who wants to make changes to a repository has their own copy of the files in the repository, along with their own copy of the changes (the <em>commits</em>) that have been made to those files. Git keeps the commits in a secret directory along with the copies of the files.</p>
<p>A service like Github acts as a central server for your repository, but it is basically just storing another copy of your repository. Github's copies are only special because we told Git that the Github version is special.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/github.svg" alt="Every user has their own copy" /><p class="caption">Every user has their own copy</p>
</div>
<p>So, if a user wants to make changes to a file in a repo that is under Git control, she can make changes to her own copy of the file and then tell Git to save those changes in its history. This is called <em>committing</em> the changes, and it saves the changes in her own copy of the repo on her own computer.</p>
<p>If she wants another user to see her changes, though, she needs to tell that other user's Git copy that she made changes. This is called <em>pushing</em> the commits to another repo. She can either push the changes directly to another user's copy, or she can push them to a centrally-designated remote repository, like one at Github.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/push.svg" alt="Pushing synchronizes changes to a different copy" /><p class="caption">Pushing synchronizes changes to a different copy</p>
</div>
<h2 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h2>
<p>The first time we use Git on a new machine, we need to make sure Git knows a few things. We can configure some basic settings with <code>git config</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> config --global user.name <span class="st">&quot;Vlad Dracula&quot;</span>
$ <span class="kw">git</span> config --global user.email <span class="st">&quot;vlad@tran.sylvan.ia&quot;</span>
$ <span class="kw">git</span> config --global color.ui <span class="st">&quot;auto&quot;</span>
$ <span class="kw">git</span> config --global core.editor <span class="st">&quot;nano&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>(Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's, and please make sure you choose an editor that's actually on your system, such as <code>notepad</code> on Windows.)</p>
<p>Git commands are written <code>git verb</code>, where <code>verb</code> is what we actually want it to do. In this case, we're telling Git:</p>
<ul>
<li>our name and email address,</li>
<li>to colorize output,</li>
<li>what our favorite text editor is, and</li>
<li>that we want to use these settings globally (i.e., for every project),</li>
</ul>
<p>The four commands above only need to be run once: the flag <code>--global</code> tells Git to use the settings for every project on this machine.</p>
<h2 id="start-version-control">Start Version Control</h2>
<p>Let's create a directory for our work. Create a new folder in your home directory and call it <code>planets_yourname</code>, open a terminal window and navigate into that directory.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> planets_yourname</code></pre>
<p>and tell Git to make this directory into a repository.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> init</code></pre>
<p>Git creates a hidden directory called <code>.git</code> in this directory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -a</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>.   ..  .git</code></pre>
<p>This hidden directory contains Git's history of all the changes and commits we're going to make. If we ever delete it, we will lose the project's history.</p>
<h2 id="tracking-changes-to-files">Tracking Changes to Files</h2>
<h3 id="create-a-file">Create a file:</h3>
<p>Let's create a file called <code>mars.txt</code> that contains some notes about the Red Planet's suitability as a base.</p>
<p>Open your favorite text editor, maybe TextWrangler on the Mac or Notepad on Windows, and start a new file. Type some text into the new file:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color</code></pre>
<p>Save this file in your planets_yourname directory as <code>mars.txt</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-our-file">Tracking our file:</h3>
<p>We can look at this repo in the Github GUI app. Launch the Github app. From the File menu, go to Add Local Repository... and add the planets directory.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/new_repo.png" alt="Add Local Repository" /><p class="caption">Add Local Repository</p>
</div>
<p>Now you should see your file <code>mars.txt</code> with its changes.</p>
<p>Let's ask Git about the status of this repo:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
#   mars.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</code></pre>
<p>We can see that our <code>mars.txt</code> file is listed as an &quot;untracked file.&quot; We can tell Git that it should track this file using <code>git add</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add mars.txt</code></pre>
<h3 id="committing-for-the-first-time">Committing for the first time:</h3>
<p>Now let's commit this file into our repo for the first time.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Starting to think about Mars&quot;</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>[master (root-commit) 189f6e7] Starting to think about Mars
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>Git takes all the changes we made this time and stores a record of those changes permanently inside the special <code>.git</code> directory. This set of changes is called a <a href="reference.html#revision">revision</a>. It assigns a unique identifier (<code>189f6e7</code>) to the commit.</p>
<div id="what-are-the-flags-for" class="callout">
<h2>What are the flags for?</h2>
<p>We use the <code>-m</code> flag (for &quot;message&quot;) to record a comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why. If we just run <code>git commit</code> without the <code>-m</code> option, Git will launch <code>nano</code> (or whatever other editor we configured at the start) so that we can write a longer message.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="looking-at-past-changes">Looking at past changes:</h3>
<p>We can look at the repo's history to see what we've done in the past.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/history.png" alt="Git history" /><p class="caption">Git history</p>
</div>
<p>From the command line, type <code>git log</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> log</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>commit 189f6e70156057a0da216b18a1bd592fd89daabf

    Starting to think about Mars</code></pre>
<p>You'll see all the revisions that were made in reverse chronological order. You can see the unique identifiers for each of the commits too: notice that the short identifier that we got from the commit message is just the first seven letters of this longer identifier. Git accepts either version of the identifier.</p>
<h2 id="changing-a-file">Changing a File</h2>
<p>Now suppose Dracula adds more information to the file. Go to the text editor where you have <code>mars.txt</code> open, and make some changes to the file:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman</code></pre>
<p>Now go back to your terminal window. When we run <code>git status</code> now, it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
#   (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The last line is the key phrase: &quot;no changes added to commit&quot;. We have changed this file, but we haven't told Git we will want it to record these changes (which we do with <code>git add</code>) much less actually committed them. So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review our changes before saving them. We do this using <code>git diff</code>. This shows us the differences between the current state of the file and the most recently committed version:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
+The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman</code></pre>
<p>The output is cryptic because it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and <code>patch</code> telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other. If we break it down into pieces:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix <code>diff</code> command comparing the old and new versions of the file.</li>
<li>The second line tells exactly which revisions of the file Git is comparing; <code>df0654a</code> and <code>315bf3a</code> are unique computer-generated labels for those revisions.</li>
<li>The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.</li>
<li>The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences and the lines on which they occur. In particular, the <code>+</code> markers in the first column show where we are adding lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Concerns about Mars&#39;s moons on my furry friend&quot;</span></code></pre>

#
no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Whoops: Git won't commit because we didn't use <code>git add</code> first. Let's fix that:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add mars.txt

<p>Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit before actually committing anything. It's sort of a double-check to make sure that you know what you're committing before you do it. For example, if you accidentally put some other file into this git-tracked directory, you probably don't want to introduce it into your git history. By explicitly adding the file first, you're saying that these are exactly the changes I want to commit.</p>
<p>Git has a special staging area where it keeps track of things that have been added to the current <a href="reference.html#change-set">change set</a> but not yet committed. <code>git add</code> puts things in this area, and <code>git commit</code> then copies them to long-term storage (as a commit):</p>

<p>Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor to the staging area and into the repository. First, add another line to the file:</p>

<p>So far, so good: we've added one line to the end of the file (shown with a <code>+</code> in the first column). Now let's put that change in the staging area and see what <code>git diff</code> reports:</p>

<p>In this way, we build up a chain of revisions. The most recent end of the chain is referred to as <code>HEAD</code>; we can refer to previous revisions using the <code>~</code> notation, so <code>HEAD~1</code> (pronounced &quot;head minus one&quot;) means &quot;the previous revision&quot;, while <code>HEAD~123</code> goes back 123 revisions from where we are now.</p>
<h2 id="recovering-old-versions">Recovering Old Versions</h2>
<p>All right: we can save changes to files and see what we've changed---how can we restore older versions of things? Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>We will need to manufacture our own oxygen</code></pre>
<p><code>git status</code> now tells us that the file has been changed, but those changes haven't been staged:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master

<p>As you might guess from its name, <code>git checkout</code> checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file. In this case, we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in <code>HEAD</code>, which is the last saved revision.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that we must use the revision number that identifies the state of the repository <em>before</em> the change we're trying to undo. A common mistake is to use the revision number of the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of. In the example below, we want retrieve the state from before the most recent commit (<code>HEAD~1</code>), which is revision <code>f22b25e</code>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/git-checkout.svg" alt="Git Checkout" /><p class="caption">Git Checkout</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates what the history of a file might look like (moving back from <code>HEAD</code>, the most recently committed version):</p>

<div id="simplifying-the-common-case" class="callout">
<h2>Simplifying the Common Case</h2>
<p>If you read the output of <code>git status</code> carefully, you'll see that it includes this hint:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">(use</span> <span class="st">&quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to discard changes in working directory<span class="kw">)</span></code></pre>
<p>As it says, <code>git checkout</code> without a version identifier restores files to the state saved in <code>HEAD</code>. The double dash <code>--</code> is needed to separate the names of the files being recovered from the command itself: without it, Git would try to use the name of the file as the revision identifier.</p>
</div>
<p>The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize their work. If everything is in one large document, it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion. If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand, moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.</p>
<p>We can also refer to revisions using those long strings of digits and letters that <code>git log</code> displays. These are unique IDs for the changes, and &quot;unique&quot; really does mean unique: every change to any set of files on any machine has a unique 40-character identifier. Our first commit was given the ID f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b, so let's try this:</p>

<p>Note that here we just used the first seven characters of the identifier: Git is fine with using this shortened form as well.</p>
<p>Using these identifiers (called SHAs) is absolutely the safest way to identify a particular revision, but there are easier ways to identify specific revisions. We'll discuss those later.</p>
<h2 id="ignoring-things">Ignoring Things</h2>
<p>What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis. Let's create a few dummy files:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">mkdir</span> results
$ <span class="kw">touch</span> a.dat b.dat c.dat results/a.out results/b.out</code></pre>
<p>and see what Git says:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
#   a.dat
#   b.dat
#   c.dat
#   results/
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</code></pre>
<p>Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. What's worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so let's tell Git to ignore them.</p>
<p>We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> .gitignore
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> .gitignore</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>*.dat
results/</code></pre>
<p>These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in <code>.dat</code> and everything in the <code>results</code> directory. (If any of these files were already being tracked, Git would continue to track them.)</p>
<p>Once we have created this file, the output of <code>git status</code> is much cleaner:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
#   .gitignore
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</code></pre>
<p>The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created <code>.gitignore</code> file. You might think we wouldn't want to track it, but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore the same things that we're ignoring. Let's add and commit <code>.gitignore</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add .gitignore
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Add the ignore file&quot;</span>
$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<p>As a bonus, using <code>.gitignore</code> helps us avoid accidentally adding files to the repository that we don't want.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add a.dat</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.dat
Use -f if you really want to add them.
fatal: no files added</code></pre>
<p>If we really want to override our ignore settings, we can use <code>git add -f</code> to force Git to add something. We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status --ignored</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
# Ignored files:
#  (use &quot;git add -f &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
#
#        a.dat
#        b.dat
#        c.dat
#        results/

nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
