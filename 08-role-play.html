<p>Collaborator: Go to your email to retrieve the <code>URL</code> to connect to the Owner’s repository.</p>
<p>Collaborator: <code>cd</code> to another directory (so <code>ls</code> doesn’t show a <code>planets</code> folder), and then make a copy of this repository on your own computer:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> clone URL_from_Collaborator</code></pre>
<p><code>git clone</code> creates a fresh local copy of a remote repository.</p>
<p>Collaborator: Make a change in their copy of the repository:</p>

<p>As soon as people can work in parallel, someone’s going to step on someone else’s toes. This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make different changes to each copy. Version control helps us manage these <a href="reference.html#conflicts">conflicts</a> by giving us tools to <a href="reference.html#resolve">resolve</a> overlapping changes.</p>
<p>Owner: Make a change to the <code>mars.txt</code> file.</p>

<p>but Git won’t let us push it to GitHub!</p>
<p>Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other and stops us from trampling on our previous work. What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub, <a href="reference.html#merge">merge</a> them into the copy we’re currently working in, and then push that.</p>
<p>Owner: Start by pulling:</p>

Auto-merging mars.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt

<p><code>git pull</code> tells us there’s a conflict, and marks that conflict in the affected file:</p>

=======
I don&#39;t think we should teach conflicts at this workshop...

<p>Our change—the one in <code>HEAD</code>—is preceded by <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>. Git has then inserted <code>=======</code> as a separator between the conflicting changes and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. (The string of letters and digits after that marker identifies the revision we’ve just downloaded.)</p>
<p>It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers and reconcile the changes. We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both, or get rid of the change entirely.</p>
<p>Owner: Use a text editor to resolve the conflict:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>

<p>We don’t need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.</p>
<p>Version control’s ability to merge conflicting changes is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into multiple files instead of storing everything in one large file. There’s another benefit too: whenever there are repeated conflicts in a particular file, the version control system is essentially trying to tell its users that they ought to clarify who’s responsible for what, or find a way to divide the work up differently.</p>
